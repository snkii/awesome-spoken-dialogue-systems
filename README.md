# Awesome Spoken Dialogue Systems [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> **“Is this a computer, or a human?”**

A curated list of **awesome spoken dialogue systems**, focusing on speech-first, real-time conversational agents.
This list covers research papers and toolkits that treat speech as the primary interface, not merely a wrapper around text-based dialogue.

This is a curation, not a collection. Only resources that meaningfully advance spoken dialogue systems toward that goal are included.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but please read carefully before submitting a pull request.

**Guidelines:**

- Only include resources you have **personally used, studied, or can strongly recommend**.
- Each entry **must explain why it is awesome** and how it helps advance spoken dialogue systems toward the goal stated at the top of this list.
- The scope is **spoken dialogue systems**.  
  Both **modular pipelines** and **end-to-end architectures** are welcome, as long as they are designed for spoken interaction.  
  Pure ASR, TTS, or text-only chat frameworks should be excluded unless they meaningfully change how spoken dialogue is modeled or experienced.
- Keep descriptions concise and end them with a period.
- Maintain consistent formatting and valid Markdown.

Respect differing opinions. If multiple contributors disagree on an inclusion, reconsider it carefully.
